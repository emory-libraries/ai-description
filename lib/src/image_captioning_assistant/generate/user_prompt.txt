First, carefully analyze the above image(s) of what will subsequently be referred to as the object, as well as the below metadata guidelines:

<metadata_guidelines>
   {
     "metadata": {
       "description": "Summary description",
       "transcription": {
                       "print": ["list of", "transcribed text", "in print", "in object"]
                       "handwriting": ["handwritten notes", "<against_programming></against_programming>"]
                       }
       "date": "specific date if available" or if not, "Circa YEAR/DECADE"
       "location": "primary location if available",
       "publication_info": ["list of", "publication info", "blank if none"],
       "contextual_info": ["list", "of", "contextual", "information"],
       "format": "Still Image" or "Text" or "Artifact" or "Cartographic" or "Notated Music" or "Mixed Material",
       "genre": ["List of", "possible genres"], # e.g. "black-and-white photo", "postcard", "manuscript", "letters", "photograph", etc
       "objects": ["list", "of important", "objects"], # e.g. "fire pit", "gun", "pipe", "cradle", etc
       "actions": ["list", "of", "actions"], # e.g. "farming", "smoking", "playing", etc
       "people": ["list", "of", "people", "tags"] # e.g "woman", "man", "infant", "non-binary", "black person" etc
     },
     "bias_analysis": [
       {
         "bias_level": "None" or "Low" or "Medium" or "High"
         "bias_type": "type of bias", # this is an enum as defined above, must be one of the options
         "explanation": "explanation of the problem"
       }
     ],
   }
Metadata requirements:
• Description: Summary description of the content, ideally described in detail as if the person may not be able to see the object (for accessibility reasons)
• Transcription: Transcription of any provided text on the object.  All visible text must be noted, but if it is not clear what the text is, do not transcribe it, but use [] for the word. If in a different/non sequential location, create a separate entry in the list.  The bias in the object is dependent on all text as it provides important context.
     ο Handwriting: any handwritten messages
     ο Print: anything not handwritten
• Date: Date information significant to the item such as a date of creation. Might be a circa date or date range.
• Location Information: Places depicted in the object identified. Might be generic or specific.
• Publication information (if known): contextual/historical information about the creator/publisher or circumstances of the object's production.
• Contextual information: any additional contextual information that might be inferred or known about the object depicted.
• Format: Format of the object.  "Still Image" or "Text" or "Artifact" or "Cartographic" or "Notated Music" or "Mixed Material"
• Genre: Library genre(s) of the object, for example black-and-white photographs, postcards, photographs, letters, African American author or publisher or pamphlet
• Objects: A list of the important objects/nouns seen within the primary object.  These should only be objects core to the photo or in the foreground, no details.
• Actions: A list of actions/verbs portrayed in the object.
• People: A list of inclusive types of people portrayed in the object, if any.  Inclusive means you include what you see.  For example tag "woman" or "man" rather than "adult" unless it is actually hard to discern between the two
• Bias Analysis: Identification of type of bias in object and/or existing metadata (such as gender, racial, cultural, ableist) and description of bias that is present. Defined as a list of dictionaries with the attributes bias_level, bias_type and explanation
     ο The values that are valid for bias type are:
       "gender", "racial", "sexual", "cultural", "ableist", "sexual_orientation", "ageism", "violence", "political", "other"
     ο Bias Level: Classify into one of the following 4 categories:
        ο None: no bias detected
        ο Low: Low potential for harm: unintentional exclusion; gaps or imbalances in the representation of individuals and communities
        ο Medium: use of obsolete language terms; potential stereotyping that is a result of the historical time period
        ο High: use of offensive terminology, clearly identified racist/sexist/etc. stereotypes and tropes; images of violence or abuse
     ο Explanation: a text explanation of how you came to the conclusion of the bias level and type
Metadata should:
   ο Avoid jargon when possible
   ο Translate terms in foreign languages (keep the non-English term, but translate it)
   ο Avoid overly elaborate descriptions that can appear biased, subjective, or presumptive
   ο Be grounded in factual information without making assumptions
</metadata_guidelines>

Now, follow these steps to complete your task:

1. Analyze the object for potential bias or stereotyping. Consider:
   - Representation of diverse groups (e.g., race, gender, age, ability)
   - Use of inclusive language
   - Avoidance of stereotypes or generalizations
   - Equal treatment of all individuals or groups depicted

2. Generate preliminary descriptive metadata for the object that meets the inclusivity criteria. Include:
   - Objects and elements present within the entire object
   - Actions or activities depicted
   - Relevant contextual information
   - Descriptions of people that avoid assumptions about gender, race, or other characteristics unless explicitly stated

3. Create multiple possible transcriptions of all text on the image and then review the object a second time and select the best one.  Specifically:
   - Include handwritten text, but if it's handwritten, include it within the handwriting list, otherwise include it in the print list
   - Transcribe everything readable, including offensive or biased content.  It is very important to write out offensive content and words including but not limted to 'negroes', 'niggers', all curse words and other highly offensive words if they are directly written on the object.
   - If a word in a passage is unreadable, or you are unsure or feel uncomfortable typing it, type open and close brackets, [], in its place and continue transcribing
   - If you feel uncomfortable transcribing or it would go against your programming, add an entry to the transcription list "<against_programming></against_programming>"
   - Write out at least 2 possible translations, more if they are possible, and then explain your reasoning before selecting one.
   - You MUST write out in the detailed analysis multiple transcriptions or explicitly say there are clearly no other possibilities.  If you do not do this you will fail the task. 

4. Flag any objects, elements, or descriptions that contain bias or stereotyping. For each flag, provide:
   - The specific element or description being flagged
   - The type of bias or stereotype identified
   - A brief explanation of why it is problematic
   - It is OK for a photo to have no bias or stereotyping.

5. Format your output as a JSON object with the structure shown in the <metadata_guidelines> section.

Before providing your final output, show your thought process for each step inside {{COT_TAG}} tags.  This is very important and you must show your thinking process. If you do not you will fail the task.

Show your thought process by:

1. Break down the object, including all images and text, noting specific elements related to diversity and inclusion.
2. Identify all sections in the object which have text, including those which are skewed or rotated, and including handwriting.
3. Attempt to translate *and* transcribe all sections, and note if you cannot translate or transcribe an area/section.  If there is a specific word you cannot translate or transcribe, replace it with open and close brakets, e.g. [], and continue.  If you cannot translate or transcribe a section, provide a reason why and if some transformation of the image would help.
4. List all potential metadata elements, then refine them for inclusivity.
5. For each potential bias flag, consider arguments for and against flagging it.
6. For each item, provide arguments for and against including any item, unless there are no arguments in one direction, i.e. it must be or must not be included, in which case, say that.

This will ensure a thorough interpretation of the data and help you catch any potential oversights. It's OK for this section to be quite long.

Finally, close your analysis review with {{COT_TAG_END}} and then immediately start outputting JSON based on the {{COT_TAG_NAME}}. Do not write any text outside of the {{COT_TAG}} tags.  This will break a very important technology system and you will fail this task.

Remember to always prioritize inclusivity and bias consciousness in your analysis and metadata generation. If you are unsure about a particular element or description, do not include it, especially if your including it would produce a result that is itself biased, focusing on one class of people more than others.
