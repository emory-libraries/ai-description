      "After careful analysis, I find low-level gender bias due to the exclusively male-focused activities and institutions mentioned, though this is largely a product of its historical context. The cultural/class elements, while present, appear to be more satirical than promoting bias, so I don't believe they rise to the level of requiring a bias flag.\n",

After journeying thither each takes unto himself his proper allotment and is about to depart when he who contributed \"Pot Pourri\" moved that draw poker be indulged in for a period. Motion unanimously carried and six decks produced immediately. In a short while the Astute One has gathered beneath his sheltering wing every shekel save those which repose in the pot. The last hand has been dealt. The artist draws nothing and retires to take refreshment. He who assists finds only a pair of deuces and he likewise suspends. The High Mogul holdeth three jacks and braveth in glee. The Popular One, being possessed of a straight,betteth jewelry, sox and other personal adornment. Being called, the Astute One produces four aces and readieth for the contents of the pot. Thus concludeth the game, both guns hanging fire.

While this was common in 1911, these elements represent harmful stereotyping and disrespect toward Native American cultures and communities. The high level is warranted due to the combination of derogatory terminology and stereotypical imagery."
