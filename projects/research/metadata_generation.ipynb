      "- The image depicts exploitative agricultural labor practices that disproportionately affected Black Americans\n",
      "- The phrase \"Sunny South\" presents a romanticized view of what was often forced or coerced labor\n",
      "- The presence of children in the cotton field suggests child labor\n",
      "- The postcard format suggests this scene was considered suitable for casual correspondence, normalizing the labor conditions\n",
      "- The image was likely created for white audiences, potentially as a form of propaganda showing \"peaceful\" agricultural work\n",

      "6. Inclusion Considerations:\n",
      "Must include:\n",
      "- Clear documentation of the labor conditions shown\n",
      "- Acknowledgment of the historical context\n",
      "- Recognition of the people's dignity despite difficult circumstances\n",
      "- Accurate description of all visible elements\n",

      "Should avoid:\n",
      "- Romanticizing the scene\n",
      "- Minimizing the serious nature of the labor\n",
      "- Making assumptions about specific relationships between people shown\n",
