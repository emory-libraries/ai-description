Python package:
    - Remove print statements for loguru logging statements
        - Initialize logger in __init__.py file
    - Check function annotations -- need types for all parameters and return types
        - mypy pre-commit hook found 61 errors across 19 files
    - Add """Description.""" to top of each .py file
    - Refactor naming, a bit too long
        - Update tests here too to match any changes in repo structure/naming
    - Combine textract + image_captioning_assistant together
        - Design patterns are completely different here

UI:
    - Add code

Terraform:
    - Integrate with UI and Python package
    - Make it better
